Calculator is going to contain functions 
for all the basic math operators

Start by creating functions for the following items
- add
- subtract
- multiply
- divide

##################################

A calculator operation will 
consist of a 
number, an operator, 
and another number

For example, 3 + 5. 
Create three variables, 
one for each part of the operation. 

Use these variables to 
update your display later.

##################################

Create a new function operate 
that takes an operator 
and two numbers and then 
calls one of the 
above functions on the numbers.
