Calculator is going to contain functions 
for all the basic math operators

Start by creating functions for the following items
- add
- subtract
- multiply
- divide

##################################

A calculator operation will 
consist of a 
number, an operator, 
and another number

For example, 3 + 5. 
Create three variables, 
one for each part of the operation. 

Use these variables to 
update your display later.

##################################

Create a new function operate 
that takes an operator 
and two numbers and then 
calls one of the 
above functions on the numbers.

##################################

Create a basic HTML calculator 
with buttons for each digit 
and operator (including =)

Don’t worry about making them 
functional just yet.

There should also be 
a display for the calculator. 
Go ahead and fill it 
with some dummy numbers 
so it looks correct.

Add a “clear” button.

##################################

Create the functions that 
populate the display when 
you click the digit buttons

store the content of 
the display (the number) in 
a variable for use in the next step

// Pseudocode

CREATE leadingZero boolean variable
CREATE displayLength variable

WHEN clicked:
    IF leadingZero equals to true 
        SET leadingZero to false
        SET display.innerText to ''

##################################

Store the first and 
second numbers input by 
the user and then operate() on 
them when the user presses 
the = button, according to 
the operator that was selected 
between the numbers.

Once operate has been called, 
update the display with 
the result of the operation

Figure out how to 
store all the values and 
call the operate function with 
them

// Pseudocode

User enters first number

WHEN operators is pressed, 
    STORE the value in a variable
    LET the operator hold down

user enters second number

WHEN equal is pressed,
    STORE the value in a variable
    CALCULATE the result
    PRINT it on the display
