Calculator is going to contain functions 
for all the basic math operators

Start by creating functions for the following items
- add
- subtract
- multiply
- divide

##################################

A calculator operation will 
consist of a 
number, an operator, 
and another number

For example, 3 + 5. 
Create three variables, 
one for each part of the operation. 

Use these variables to 
update your display later.

##################################

Create a new function operate 
that takes an operator 
and two numbers and then 
calls one of the 
above functions on the numbers.

##################################

Create a basic HTML calculator 
with buttons for each digit 
and operator (including =)

Don’t worry about making them 
functional just yet.

There should also be 
a display for the calculator. 
Go ahead and fill it 
with some dummy numbers 
so it looks correct.

Add a “clear” button.

##################################

Create the functions that 
populate the display when 
you click the digit buttons

store the content of 
the display (the number) in 
a variable for use in the next step

##################################

// pseudocode

CREATE leadingZero boolean variable
CREATE displayLength variable

WHEN clicked:
    IF leadingZero equals to true 
        SET leadingZero to false
        SET display.innerText to ''
